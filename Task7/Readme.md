## 🧩Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

Here I've used the Microsoft Edge Web Browser. You can opt any of your desired web browser for doing this task.

### 🔍 What I Did:

#### ✅ Step 1: Opened Extension Manager 
- Navigated to `extensions` in Edge
- Reviewed all installed extensions

#### ✅ Step 2: Evaluated Each Extension
- Checked:
  - Extension name and developer
  - Permissions requested (e.g., access to all websites, clipboard, etc.)
  - Whether I actually use it

#### ✅ Step 3: Identified Unused Extensions
- Flagged extensions that:
  - Had excessive permissions
  - Were unused
  
#### ✅ Step 4: Removed Unnecessary Extensions
- Uninstalled the Guardian Extension which I'm not using.
- Restarted the browser to apply changes

Noticed faster browser startup and fewer background processes

### 🧠 Key Learnings

- Extensions can be powerful but also risky if they have too many permissions.
- Always check what data an extension can access before installing.
- Removing unused extensions improves both security and performance.

### 🧪 Research Summary: How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users

- **Data Theft**: Some extensions can read passwords, cookies, or personal data.
- **Ad Injection**: Inject unwanted ads or redirect traffic to malicious sites.
- **Tracking**: Monitor browsing habits and sell data to third parties.
